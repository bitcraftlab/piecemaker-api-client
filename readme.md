**Piecemaker API wrapper for Java and JavaScript**

This client's API implementation is based upon the new/upcoming [Piecemaker 2.0 API](https://github.com/motionbank/piecemaker2-api).

*Note that this is still work in process as we approach our [final release end of 2013](http://motionbank.org/en/event/motion-bank-live-online-2013)*

Uses jQuery for JS XHR and Apache Commons for Java.
